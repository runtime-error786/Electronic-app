## Step 1: Start the Metro Server

# using npm

# OR using Yarn
yarn start
```

# using npm
npm run android

```

If everything is set up _correctly_, you should see your new app running in your _Android Emulator_ or _iOS Simulator_ shortly provided you have set up your emulator/simulator correctly.

This is one way to run your app â€” you can also run it directly from within Android Studio and Xcode respectively.

## Congratulations!
