In this project, there are three roles: guest, customer, and admin. In the guest pages, products are displayed but cannot be added to the cart. In the customer role, products can be added to the cart, and the profile page is accessible. The admin role allows for dropping, updating, and adding product information. Additionally, admins can view graphs of sales.

## Step 1: Start the Metro Server

```bash
# using npm
npm start

# OR using Yarn
yarn start
```

## Step 2: Start your Application
# using npm
npm run android

# OR using Yarn
yarn android
```

### For iOS

```bash
# using npm
npm run ios

# OR using Yarn
yarn ios
```

If everything is set up _correctly_, you should see your new app running in your _Android Emulator_ or _iOS Simulator_ shortly provided you have set up your emulator/simulator correctly.

This is one way to run your app â€” you can also run it directly from within Android Studio and Xcode respectively.

## Congratulations!
